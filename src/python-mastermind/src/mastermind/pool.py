"""
Module providing the `Pool` class for managing a process pool

Pool overrides the standard library implementation (multiprocessing/pool.py).

Standard implementation of Pool supports only synchronous processing of
tasks by target function (see `worker` function in multiprocessing/pool.py).
In case when a task is partially I/O-bound we can benefit from processing
several tasks at a time.
Current implementation provides PoolWorker base class that controls
task fetching from queue, processes tasks as coroutines and
pushes results to result queue (basically replaces original
multiprocessing.pool.worker's routine).

NB: this module mostly uses original code-style of standard library
for easier code maintaining when comparing code with the one from standard
library.

This implementation uses the original task format of the original pool:

    (job_id, task_id, func, args, kwds),

where:
    - job is a batch of tasks and is used on the client side to
    pass results to the user;
    - task id is sequential integer which is used to restore order
    of results;
    - `func` is used by the original Pool implementation and is not
    supported, this is replaced by subclassing PoolWorker and
    providing its `process` method;
    - args and kwds are passed to `process` method of worker
    implementation.

This format is not changed to retain support of ApplyResult-
and IMapIterator-based result objects of standard implementation.

Due to the fact that this implementation redefines some "private"
methods of `Pool` and `SimpleQueue` classes, it is heavily
dependent on current implementation. This means that it should be
covered by tests thoroughly to spot any inconsistencies and
implementation changes.
