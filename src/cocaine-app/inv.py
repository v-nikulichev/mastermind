    Inventory is designed as a general tool to provide
    information about specific infrastructure environment
    to mastermind.

    Inventory implementation can be provided using
    'inventory' config section using module name as a value
    (NB: this module should be importable by python interpreter).
    If either custom inventory is not provided or is not importable
    mastermind will fall back to default implementation of
    @fake_inventory module.

    Inventory API is fully described in @fake_inventory module.
